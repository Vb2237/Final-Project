# Cafeteria Inspections
My code for NYC Schools Cafeteria Inspections perfomed by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH)

Step 1: Install R Studio, Excel, and Tableau Desktop.
Step 2: Download this code! 

A total of 4 visualizations were created for this project and each had a specific goal.
Goal 1 is txplore trends over time (Line graph). Goal 2 is to find out what percentage of total violations are critical level inspections (Bar graph)
Goal 3 is to locate at count of violations on a map (Bubble Map Chart). Goal 4 is to explore violation descriptions (Descriptive Table).
